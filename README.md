# Quick description
For now this package is in its infancy, and who knows how useful it will be in the end. Anyways, I need to back things up and perhaps it wouldn't hurt to practice some version control.

Quick summary of the files here:
1. script\_utils.py - the main handler of all script stuff like arguments, importing stuff, etc.
2. data\_utils.py - the main handler of all *general* data processing.
3. SARRACEN\_temp\_density\_plot.py - using the SARRACEN package <font color="red">[ADD LINK]</font> to plot N densest particles in a density vs. temp from dump files.
4. SPLASH\_maxvals\_temp\_density\_plot.py - using the SPLASH package <font color="red">[ADD LINK]</font> to plot global max vals for density vs. temp from dump files.
5. main\_single.py - for now, an incomplete file. Hopefully this will be absorbed into SARRACEN\_temp\_density\_plot.py
